#summary Instructions for getting nvdCache to work.
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

These are the basic instructions needed to get nvdCahce up and working.

= Requirements =

1) Access to a MySQL database server
2) An Apache server with PHP (only tested on version 5.2.3)


= Initial Installation =

1) Download the release package found here --> (link here)
2) Move the nvdCache.tar.gz file to the root of your web server 'mv nvdCache.tar.gz /var/www/.' <-- (that works for some versions of linux) Your web server root may be different than what is listed.  Please work with your administrator to properly determine this.
3) un-gzip the file 'gzip -d nvdCache.tar.gz'
4) un-tar the file 'tar -xvf nvdCache.tar'
5) Remove the old tar file 'rm nvdCache.tar'

= Database readiness =

1) How ever you do it, ie. command line or phpMyAdmin create a data base with the name *nvdCache*
2) Execute against the database the contents of the nvdCache_db.sql file against your newly created database.  From the command line you could do this 'mysql -u'db user name here' -p < nvdCache_db.sql'
